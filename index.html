<h1>ðŸ”¥ FLAME, a SATLE funded project bringing interactive 3D to teaching and learning</h1>
<p>The Strategic Alignment of Teaching and Learning Enhancement (SATLE) Funding in Higher Education Funding aims to develop innovations in education for sustainable development, digital transformation and academic integrity.
The funding is administered by the National Forum in partnership with the Higher Education Authority.
Many subject domains introduce abstract or complex concepts that can be diffcult for students to grasp from images, sketches and 2D diagrams. 
This can result in many students being left behind as more advanced topics building on these core core concepts are introduced.
The FLAME project aims to give educators the capability and support needed to create interactive 3D animated learning experiences natively in the browser under the themes of digital transformation and enhanced online learning.
The use of such rich material can be highly engaging. It can allow students studying history or archaeolgy to explore 3D scans of important artefacts.
Medial students can augment their anatomical knowledge with easily accessed 3D scans of patients.
In engineering complex gas turbine engines can be dismantled and the complex geometries within examined while in mathmatics foundational concepts in calculus demystifed.
</p>
</div>
    
<div class="container">
</p>
The FLAME project achieves this through the use of a number of powserful open source tools. 
3D models can be imported into or created from scratch in the 3D creation suite <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>.
This software allows the models to be animated in a wide range of ways as will be explored below.
Once created the animated 3D models can be hosted on Github and rendered via Google's <a href="https://modelviewer.dev/">Model-Viewer</a> web component.
This easy to resource makes deploying 3D on the web easy. This page contains several examples of what is possible. 
This allows your learning materials to exist outside of static slides in a rich multimedia environment. 
Can you imagine any topics from your teaching that would benefit from this?
    
Try and grab the UCD logo and give it a spin.

<p>This simple demo shows how a static object can be manuipulated and explored to give new insights into shape and form.
    You can scroll or pinch to zoom. Hold the shift key, or drag with two fingers to pan the model.
    You can admire the gold material used on the logo's harp for example.
    
    We are all familar with the power of 3D animation in movies and games and it can look very complicated at first glance.
    However, most animation comprises three simple transformations: translation, rotation and scale.
    Simple animations using just translation and rotation can be used to explore the behaviour of rigid mechanical systems such as this approximation of an internal combustion engine.
    The translating pistons cause the crank shaft to rotate via the connecting rods.
    Rotating the model to the side shows the inline arrangement of the pistons
    The addition of a play/pause button allows for further exploration during the combustion cycle.
    Additions to this model may be added to further build understanding of the four stroke cycle.

<p>
    
    While the combination of translation, rotation and scale is powerful many systems we wish to teach about undergo complex deformation.
    Biological systems are comprised of soft matter, metals bend under load, and fabric deform.
    Using the same tools, deformation can also be presented to help students understand the complexity of objects that change shape.
    Here the Stanford Bunny 3D scan is revealed from under a deforming cloth. An image texture is mapped to the cloth which faithfully follows the material deformation.
    Data from numerical simulation of deforming systems can be imported and displayed just like this example.

<p>What if you want more control over the animation? What if you want to scrub it like a video?
    Using JavaScript it is possible to control playback with a simple slider. You can also view the moded in Augmented Reality on your phone or tablet.

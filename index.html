Many subject domains introduce abstract or complex concepts that can be difficult for students to grasp from photographs, diagrams and sketches alone. Disability and variation in spatial reasoning can lead to inequalities in learning. Student background can also play a role; those with prior hands-on experience may have an advantage over those who may not yet have had an opportunity to experience the form and function of physical artefacts.
</p>
<p>
These difficulties can result in many students being left behind as more advanced topics are built on these core abstract concepts.
The FLAME project aims to give educators the capability and support needed to create interactive 3D animated learning experiences natively in the browser under the themes of digital transformation and enhanced online learning. 
This page contains some examples of what is possible.
Authoring these experiences requires technical expertise, specialist software and time. The FLAME project aims to streamline the process by providing training, in-depth support and helpful templates.
A summer workshop will help participants create material that can be included in the forthcoming academic year.
Student focus groups will be used to determine the value and effectiveness of the new material.
A Digital Library of key material relevant to many domains will be curated for dissemination across the education sector. 
This will allows educators to find open-access material that meets their needs and also a mechanism to request new materials.
The Digital Library will be online in September 2023.
</p>
<p>
The use of such rich material can be highly engaging and offers new approaches to learning. 
The materials can be integrated into lecture notes and explored interactively in class and also at home on any device with a web browser.
In laboratory documents students can explore a piece of apparatus virtually before a lab session starts.
The technology used offers seamless viewing in augmented reality and is therefore ready for future deployments as mixed reality technologies become more prevalent and the need for suitable material grows.
The materials may also be simply rendered to video, if required, but the interactivity is a key component.
This allow students studying archaeology to robustly explore scans of fragile and unaccessible artefacts.
Medical students can augment their anatomical knowledge with 3D models derived from patient data rendered with physically accurate material shaders that capture the appearance of tissue.
In engineering gas-turbine engines can be virtually dismantled and the complex geometries within examined while in mathematics foundational concepts in calculus may be demystified by connecting equations to animated renderings of what they may represent.
An important aspect of the self authorship proposed by the FLAME project is to meet the challenges posed by high-production quality but perhaps dubious online media such as YouTube videos which students may use to support learning.
</p>
<p>
Details of the summer workshop are available below via a registration link.
</p>
<p>
FLAME is funded under the Strategic Alignment of Teaching and Learning Enhancement (SATLE) Funding in Higher Education Funding aims to develop innovations in education for sustainable development, digital transformation and academic integrity.
The funding is administered by the National Forum in partnership with the Higher Education Authority.
</p>
</div>
    
<div class="container">
</p>
The FLAME project achieves all of this through the use of open source tools. 
3D models can be imported into or created from scratch in the 3D creation suite <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blender</a>.

A number of demos are presented below to give a flavour of what is possible with this technology &mdash; however given the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRqY_20ti9A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">power</a> of animation software this may be only limited by your imagination.

Once created the animated 3D models can be hosted on the web and rendered via Google's <a href="https://modelviewer.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Model-Viewer</a> web component.
ModelViewer is designed to make deploying 3D on the web easy, but the materials may also be included in PowerPoint as it now supports inclusion of 3D models, but with limited animation functionality.
Github pages offers an ideal platform to host this material online and BrightSpace integration is under review.    
</p>
<p>
Let's look at some examples!

Try and grab the UCD logo and give it a spin.
</p>
</div>

<div class="container">
<model-viewer 
    id="interactive-UCD-logo"
    src="https://nolankucd.github.io/SATLE_FLAME_UCD/UCD_logo.glb"
    camera-controls

    field-of-view="35deg"
    auto-rotate>
</model-viewer>

<p>This simple demo shows how a static object can be manipulated and explored to give new insights into shape and form.
    You can scroll or pinch to zoom. Hold the shift key, or drag with two fingers to pan the model.
    You can admire the gold material used on the logo's harp for example.
</p>
<p> 
    We are all familiar with the power of 3D animation in movies and games and it can look very complicated at first glance.
    However, most animation comprises three simple transformations: translation, rotation and scale.
    Simple animations using just translation and rotation can be used to explore the behaviour of rigid mechanical systems such as this approximation of an internal combustion engine.
    The translating pistons result in the rotation of the crank shaft via the connecting rods.
    Rotating the model to the side shows the inline arrangement of the pistons.
    The addition of a play/pause button allows for further exploration at any point in the cycle.
    Additions to this model such as the engine block, valves and cam shaft may be added to further build understanding of the combustion cycle.
</p>

<div style="position: relative;">

<div class="container">
<p>
    While the combination of translation, rotation and scale is powerful, many systems we wish to teach about undergo complex deformations.
    Biological systems are comprised of soft matter, metals bend under load, and fabrics deform.
    Using the same tools, deformation can also be presented to help students understand the complexity of objects that change shape.
    Here the famous Stanford Bunny is revealed from under a deforming cloth. An image texture is mapped to the undeformed cloth which then faithfully follows the material deformation.
    Data from numerical simulations of deforming systems can be imported and displayed just like this example.
    Furthermore, the inclusion of a slider allows the animation to be scrubbed much like video playback.
    Herein lies the strength of this type of interactive media, learners can stop, reorientate, and replay an event at a speed that suits their needs.

</div>
    
<div class="container">
<p>
    What if you want even more control over the animation? What if you want to deform the model and control the playback speed separately?
    It is possible to control playback of different animation tracks independently much as you might have different video tracks in a NLE video editing package.
    You can also view the model in Augmented Reality on your phone or tablet by clicking the button.

<p>This final demo shows a civil engineering example related to wind loading on a bridge deck.
The addition of text hotspots offers a guided experience to draw attention to specific parts of a scene.
The ModelViewer web component offers sophisticated interactions where the camera view can be guided from hotspot to hotspot.
